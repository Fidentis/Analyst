1;Exocanthion R;The point at the outer commissure of the eye where the outer margin of the upper eyelid meets the lower eyelid. If the precise spot cannot be found then the location is in the intersection of imaginary lines obtained by prolonging the eyelid margins. The point is bilateral.
2;Exocanthion L;The point at the outer commissure of the eye where the outer margin of the upper eyelid meets the lower eyelid. If the precise spot cannot be found then the location is in the intersection of imaginary lines obtained by prolonging the eyelid margins. The point is bilateral.
3;Endocanthion R;The point at the inner commissure of the eye where the inner margin of the upper eyelid meets the lower eyelid. It is the most medial point at the lacrimal caruncle. In case a skin fold is present (epicanthus, plica mongolica, plica marginalis fetis) and the point is not visible, by Kolar and Salter’s recommendations (1997) the landmark is defined as the point where the fold crosses the lower eyelid. In this case the points are not homologous. The point is bilateral.

21;Crista philtri L;The point located at the place where the line, which is going through the highest margins of the upper vermilion, meets the lower margin of crista philtri. The point is bilateral.
22;Sublabiale;The midpoint of the mentolabial sulcus (the ridge between the chin and the lower lip, not the vermilion). The point is located at the flexion point of the concavity.

From lateral view the point is located at the extension to the posterior eyebrow margin (alternatively, at the eyebrow margin). The eye centers are defined as intersection of line connecting exo/endocanthion and of palpebra superior/inferior. The point is bilateral.
